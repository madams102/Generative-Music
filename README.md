# Generative-Music
Week 1: Data Interpretation, figure out a method of representing MIDI files in a format that can be fed into a neural net
Week 2: Assemble a basic neural net template that can be altered to best suit the project later on (variable sizes of hidden layers, inputs)
Week 3: Begin training the NN
Week 4: By this point, have a neural net with an optimal amount of hidden layers, and figure out what a good amount of iterations for training would be
Week 5: As a neural net without memory is probably suboptimal, start work on a LSTM (or similar) network structure
Week 6: Continue research/production of a LSTM network 
Week 7: LSTM Network training/tuning of size and iterations
Week 8: Learn methods of getting a NN to "play along" with the generated songs in alternate voices, such as drums or a bass
Week 9: Continue from last week, hopefully with some decent progress on implementation
Week 10: Continue from last week, maybe with another voice if the one that was chosen works well enough
